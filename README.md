## Description

Toy neural network, not optimized for speed, but perfect for game AIs, demo projects, or education. Fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network. Output is clamped to either zero or one. No backpropagation is currently provided, but a basic genetic mutation algorithm is implemented.

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Provided testing uses Jest on a Node environment. Please note that special configuration has been made for Node and for Jest to both use ECMAScript modules (<code>import</code> instead of the Common.js <code>require()</code>).

The following was inserted into <code>package.json</code> for testing to work.

```json
"type": "module",
"jest": {
    "transform": {}
},
"scripts": {
  "test": "node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js"
}
```
